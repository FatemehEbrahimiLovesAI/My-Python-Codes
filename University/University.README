User Authentication System in the Faculty

This project is designed to provide a structured framework for managing and organizing various aspects of a university's operations. The current implementation includes a basic class structure representing the main entities within a university setting. The classes are defined to establish a solid foundation for future development, allowing for the implementation of methods and functionalities at a later stage.

Current Structure

Main Classes

1. University: Represents the university as a whole, serving as the top-level entity.


2. Faculty: Represents individual faculties within the university.


3. Field_of_study: Represents different fields of study available in the university.


4. Course_unit: Represents individual course units offered in various fields of study.



User Classes

1. Student: Represents students enrolled in the university.


2. Personnel: Serves as a base class for different types of university personnel:

Professor: Represents academic staff responsible for teaching and research.

Guard: Represents security personnel.

DinningHallStaff: Represents staff working in the dining hall, which is further divided into:

Cook: Represents cooking staff.

Server: Represents serving staff.





Each class currently includes the following methods: __init__ (constructor), __str__ (string representation), and __repr__ (representation in development contexts). These methods are placeholders for future functionality.

Planned Features

1. Methods for Classes:

Each class will be extended with relevant methods to perform specific functionalities. For example, methods for managing courses, handling student registrations, or performing administrative tasks.



2. Role-Specific Panels:

Student Panel: A dedicated interface for students to access their information, enroll in courses, and view schedules.

Professor Panel: A panel for professors to manage course materials, track student progress, and submit grades.

Administration Panel: A management interface for university administrators to oversee operations, manage staff, and ensure smooth functionality.


All panels will authenticate users based on their national ID.


3. Graphical User Interface (GUI):

A user-friendly graphical interface will be developed to make the system accessible and intuitive. This interface will cater to students, professors, and administrators, providing easy navigation and robust interaction with the system.
